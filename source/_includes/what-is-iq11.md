## Overview of Token Use Cases

If you already have your customers' ITA information, you can submit that in exchange for an iQ11 token. Thereafter, the token can be used in lieu of ITA for transactions.

If you don't already have the ITA, you can either invite your customer to provide their banking info through VoPay's secure web interface; or, you can embed this interface as a step within your solution. Then you would receive an associated iQ11 token when your customer uses this interface to enter ITA or authenticate with their bank.

The guide will elaborate on each of the above approaches.
