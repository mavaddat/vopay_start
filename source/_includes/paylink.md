## Paylink Invitation

A third method to acquire an iQ11 token is to use Paylink to request your customer's ITA or banking authorization. Your customer will receive an email inviting them to provide you their banking info using VoPay's secure graphical user interface; then, you receive an iQ11 token when they login to their bank (or, when they manually enter their ITA).
